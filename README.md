# Face_Generation_Udacity

The `ipynb` file in this `repo` has implemented and passed the requirements for Udacity face generation project in deep learning Nano-degree.

## Usage
A GAN was developed from scratch to generate new faces. The generator and discriminator was designed seperately with use of CNNs. 

## Restrictions

- `cuda` is needed to run most of the code in `ipynb` file as it is highly computation intense.

## Cloning

- If anyone needs to clone the file following link can be used.
